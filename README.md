# PulsePAL - A Health Monitoring Device

### **Project Name**: PulsePAL - A health monitoring device for measuring heart rate and pulse using a fingertip sensor.

### **Project Objective**:
Developed a pulse oximeter that displays heart rate and oxygen saturation levels using photodetector and LED technology.

### **Components Used**:
- **IR and Red LEDs**
- **Photodiode**
- **Transimpedance Amplifier**
- **Active High-Pass Filter**
- **Peak Detector**
- **Comparator Circuit**

### **System Implementation**:
- Designed and tested the circuit on a breadboard.
- Integrated with Arduino for real-time heart rate monitoring and data visualization.

### **Challenges and Achievements**:
- Overcame initial IR LED malfunction.
- Refined signal amplification and filtering.
- Successfully developed a heartbeat indicator using comparator logic.
