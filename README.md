# Pulse-PAl
Project Name: PulsePAL - A health monitoring device for measuring heart rate and pulse using a fingertip sensor.
Project Objective: Developed a pulse oximeter that displays heart rate and oxygen saturation levels using photodetector and LED technology.
Components Used: Implemented IR and Red LEDs, a photodiode, transimpedance amplifier, active high-pass filter, peak detector, and comparator circuit.
System Implementation: Designed and tested circuit on a breadboard; integrated with Arduino for real-time heart rate monitoring and data visualization.
Challenges and Achievements: Overcame initial IR LED malfunction, refined signal amplification and filtering, and successfully developed a heartbeat indicator using comparator logic.
